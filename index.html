                    <p style="text-align:justify">After five long but hardworking years, Winter Haven High School’s robotics team finally gained their rightful spot at the VEX World Competition. The team has been to a multitude of VEX tournaments that tested their skills in designing, operating, and improving their robots. These experiences helped them acquire the skills and knowledge to progress in their robotics education and career. From their humble beginnings as a team of three who knew nothing at all about robots, to their current team who is very competent in the craft, they have really made great strides in becoming successful. </p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">It all began in the year 2012 when WHHS first started becoming involved with the VEX robotics scene. The first team consisted of sophomores Allan and Andrew and freshman Kristianna who were under the guidance of Mr. Hall. Since this was their very first year, it was more of a time to become familiarized and acquainted with robotics as a whole. As expected, they had poor results for the Florida State TSA VEX Competition during that school year, however it was an eye opening experience of personal research, advising from other teams with more experience, and trial and error. Mr. Hall and these three bright students formed the cornerstone of what would be an excellent robotics team the following year. </p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">The 2013 school year was a huge turnaround for WHHS robotics. With the addition of skilled programmer Joseph (junior), their team was now complete. They competed again in the Florida State TSA VEX Competition and did a terrific job performing well in all areas, a big improvement from the previous year. Their best achievement, placing 1st overall and winning VEX Excellence which qualified them for the National TSA VEX Competition where they placed in 8th, and The Florida VEX State competition where they held the 8th alliance.</p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">During the 2014 year, the team continued growing through their participation in a number of other tournaments and with the addition of new members. They were able to branch off and create a second team with their very own robot. 5245B was established in order to accommodate the influx of underclassmen joining in. The first new tournament they all joined was the Tampa League, which was a series of qualification rounds over the course of several days with a final tournament at the very end. The senior team (5245) ended up winning Tournament Champion at League, while the junior team qualified for VEX State thanks to their high score in programming skills. Another tournament the senior team attended was the Lakewood Ranch Tournament where they won the Design Award, qualifying themselves for VEX State as well. Finally both of the teams showed up at VEX State, but received mixed results. This was because of either good and/or bad pairings with other school teams which in turn, provided unfair measurements of true individual skill. Despite the mixups and fallbacks, most of the WHHS team can agree that all of it was a fun and enriching learning experience.</p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">Year 2015 was a little odd because the seniors had graduated, thus retiring team 5245. Three different team groups were formed. There was an all girls team (5245D) led by Kristianna from team 5245, an all sophomores team (5245B), the more experienced of the group, and a team that contained a mix of years and levels of experience (5245C). Unfortunately groups 5245B and 5245C were not able to qualify for VEX States that year. However, group 5245D did a pretty good job. They participated in the Tampa League and won the Judges Award. They then went to VEX States and ranked 9th. </p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">Then comes 2016 when WHHS really hit it hard at home. Juniors Zach and Arthur, and sophomore Halan, represented the school as the only three to take part in competitive robotics. As opposed to last year, this team contains the brightest individuals in robotics WHHS has to offer. They did participate in the Tampa League again and did well throughout the qualification rounds, but unfortunately did not place in the finals. However, the team then competed at Palm Bay Magnet Tournament winning the Judge’s Award and qualifying for VEX State through their combined skill scores. Finally at VEX State, they managed to grind out the rounds all the way to semi-finals under the leadership of Zach which is a new record for them and the team’s first time ever qualifying for worlds.  </p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">Zach and his team expect to compete at the VEX Worlds Competition come April 19-25 at Louisville, Kentucky. “It’s an amazing feeling that I was able to make it further than my mentors,” says Zach. When asked how this year’s team was better than the previous teams, Zach replied, “We were lucky we hooked onto a design early enough and stuck with it. This year’s robot design was definitely the best we’ve ever had, and it’s thanks to our team’s knowledge that we were able to execute it.” Zach mentioned how he and his team plan to improve their robot by making it move faster and work more efficiently for April. He also mentioned how he would like to thank alumni Kristianna (designer) and Joseph (programmer) for all the tips they gave him the past two years. Last but not least, he would like to thank Mr. Hall for making this all possible to begin with. “All it takes is good mentorship and a little bit of self-teaching,” says Kristianna, an alumni of WHHS and the robotics competition team. And that’s all it takes to become great at anything - a proper learning environment and the right people to guide you along the way.  </p>
