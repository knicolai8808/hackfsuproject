It has a 2 motor claw with a 7:1 gear ratio to be able to handle a 6 to 8 star capacity and 2 cube capacity. Our robot has a 4 motor speed geared drive for quick maneuvering and a reverse bulldog for stability. We are able to consistently high hang at the end of matches. We are currently working on a 10 pt autonomous with a backup 5 pt autonomous program.</p>
