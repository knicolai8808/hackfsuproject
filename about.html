It has a 2 motor claw with a 7:1 gear ratio to be able to handle a 6 to 8 star capacity and 2 cube capacity. Our robot has a 4 motor speed geared drive for quick maneuvering and a reverse bulldog for stability. We are able to consistently high hang at the end of matches.

As Secondary Driver if anything happens then I would drive for that match, as a Support/Team Manager however, I have to keep track of batteries, supplies, the engineering notebook, and anything else that needs to be done. My favorite part is the competitive vibe that you get at finals.
